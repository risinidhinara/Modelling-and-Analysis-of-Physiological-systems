# Report on analysis of cardiac physiology ✅

**File:** `Report_on_analysis_of_cardiac_physiology_210321X.pdf`

**Description:**
A PDF report containing analysis and results related to cardiac physiology. Add a short summary, keywords, author information, and any relevant notes here.

**How to open:**
- Download or open the PDF with your preferred PDF viewer (Adobe Reader, Evince, Preview, etc.).

**Notes:**
- If you maintain a citation or abstract, add it above so others can quickly understand the content.

**Simulation instructions (use CircAdapt):**
- In this assignment, you will use **CircAdapt** simulation software to simulate **normal cardiac rhythm** and **cardiac rhythm during aortic valve stenosis**. Prepare a report explaining the answers and including the relevant plots.

- You may refer to articles on **Wiggers diagram** as a starting point to this assignment.

- You can download the CircAdapt Simulator (v1.1.0 or #2) at: https://www.circadapt.org/download-links/

**Report guidance:**
- Include relevant plots (e.g., pressure-volume loops, ventricular pressure and volume time series, ECG traces if available).
- Describe the simulation setup and parameters so results are reproducible (e.g., model version, parameter changes to simulate stenosis, simulation time, sampling rate).
- Discuss differences observed between normal and aortic valve stenosis conditions and relate findings to the Wiggers diagram where appropriate.

> **Tip:** Add captions for each figure and include units for all plotted quantities to aid interpretation.
