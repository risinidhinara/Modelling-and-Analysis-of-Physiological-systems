# Signal Processing — Overview

**Description:**
This folder contains materials and code related to signal processing analysis and exercises.

**Contents:**
- `signal_processing_report.pdf` — Project/report describing the analysis and results
- `signal_processing_analysis.m` — MATLAB script implementing signal-processing analyses (e.g., filtering, spectral analysis, feature extraction)
- `README.md` — This overview and instructions

**Suggested tasks:**
- Load signals and apply filtering (bandpass, notch)
- Compute spectral estimates (FFT, Welch PSD)
- Extract time-domain features (RMS, peak-to-peak, envelope)
- Visualize signals and results (time series, spectrograms, PSDs)

**Notes:**
- Add supporting data files and notebooks as needed.
