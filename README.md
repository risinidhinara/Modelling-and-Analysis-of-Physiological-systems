# Modelling-and-Analysis-of-Physiological-systems

This repository contains modeling and analysis documents for physiological systems. Each PDF has been placed in its own folder with a corresponding `README.md` describing the file.

## Documents

- `Report_on_analysis_of_cardiac_physiology_210321X/` — Report on analysis of cardiac physiology
- `Simulation_of_Respiratory_Mechanics_210321X_2/` — Simulation of respiratory mechanics
- `Biosignal_Processing/` — Biosignal processing materials (cardiac and respiratory analysis)
- `Neuronal_Dendrite/` — Dendrite voltage profiles (MATLAB script + assignment PDF)
- `Signal_Processing/` — Signal processing materials (report and analysis script)

Feel free to open the PDFs in their folders and update the per-file `README.md` files with summaries, authors, citations, or simulation details.
