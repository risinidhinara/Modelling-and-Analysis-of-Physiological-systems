# Simulation of Respiratory Mechanics ✅

**File:** `Simulation_of_Respiratory_Mechanics_210321X_2.pdf`

**Description:**
A PDF describing simulations and models of respiratory mechanics. Add a short summary, simulation parameters, and any references here.

**How to open:**
- Open the PDF with your preferred PDF viewer.

**Notes:**
- Consider adding example commands or data used to run the simulations if available.

**Simulation instructions (use this simulator):**
- Use the simulator developed by **David Leonardo Rodriguez Sarmiento** and **Daniela Acevedo Guerrero** (2020), “Simulation of Respiratory Mechanics on Simulink with GUI” — MATLAB Central File Exchange: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/75335-simulation-of-respiratory-mechanics-on-simulink-with-gui

- Simulate the following conditions for an **adult**:
  1. **Normal**
  2. **Restrictive pulmonary disease** (choose one and describe your choice)
  3. **Obstructive pulmonary disease** (choose one and describe your choice)

- In your report include:
  - Graphs showing ventilation (e.g., tidal volume, respiratory rate, flow) over time
  - A discussion comparing **minute ventilation** across the three conditions using the same ventilator settings

> **Tip:** If possible, include simulation parameters (lung compliance, resistance, ventilator settings) so results are reproducible.
